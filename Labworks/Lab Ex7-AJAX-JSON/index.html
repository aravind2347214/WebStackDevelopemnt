            Develop a Web Application that uses AJAX to fetch JSON data from a remote server 
            and displays it on a web page. Fetch a list of fictional books from a JSON API and 
            display them on the webpage.The index.html file contains a button labeled "Fetch Books" 
            and a div element with the id "bookList" where we will display the list of books.
            Use JavaScript to add a click event listener to the "Fetch Books" button. When the button 
            is clicked, an AJAX request is made to fetch the JSON data from a local file called books.json 
            (you can replace it with your API URL).
            Once the JSON data is fetched successfully, it's parsed, and the displayBooks function is 
            called to render the list of books on the webpage
